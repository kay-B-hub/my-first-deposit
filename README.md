this is my first deposit


hey this is the first time I write something like this and I am learning about this website. 
I created a new account here and I am learning about github as it was the hardest thing for me because I used to come here and try to understand how it works but I have never had the patience to learn and it used to make me angry when I dont understand what a repository is and what is this website and how am I going to use it and for what. Now I get it. I have to say that tutorial is very good and simple for beginners. I have to get used to this website so I can use it in the future and deal with it. I am learning so.. we will see what happens and where I will go from here..
